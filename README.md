# all-samo-papers
A collection of all South African Maths Olympiad papers from 1997 to 2022. 
Papers come from the South African Maths Foundation website, https://www.samf.ac.za/en/samo-question-papers. 

There are some papers seemingly missing, but to my knowledge and ability, and as of the 4th of March 2023, these are all the papers available on the above link.
